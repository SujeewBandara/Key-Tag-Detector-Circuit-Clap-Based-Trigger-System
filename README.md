# Key-Tag-Detector-Circuit-Clap-Based-Trigger-System

Key Tag Detector Circuit – Clap-Activated Finder (Analog Design)
This project is a fully analog key tag detector circuit that activates a buzzer when it detects two consecutive hand claps within a 2-second window, offering a practical solution to help locate misplaced keys. The circuit is designed without any integrated circuits (ICs), using only discrete components such as:

8 transistors

Resistors and capacitors

A microphone

A small piezo buzzer

The system performs signal amplification, filtering, timing logic, and tone generation—entirely through analog circuitry. The project was developed under strict design constraints, offering a valuable learning experience in analog electronics.

## Learning Outcomes:
Translating high-level functional requirements into detailed circuit designs

Selecting suitable analog components for signal detection and processing

Implementing timing circuits to measure intervals between claps

Designing a tone generation circuit

Building and debugging analog circuits under component and tool constraints

This design involved 8 transistors used to construct amplification stages, timing logic, delay gates, and tone generation circuits—demonstrating what’s possible without digital logic or ICs.
